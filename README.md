### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Im Jamie Andrews welcome to my GitHub profile.

## About Me
I got started in development at the beginning of 2020 previously I had only built computers, configured them and earned a comptia A+ certificate. I began learning Html, Css and Javascript then NodeJs as a backend language. I used what I knew to build a site for my wifes business to save on the money she would spend on wix, just before I had picked up React and used Gatsby. I went about building the site in nextjs and used Typescript.

I have been enjoying learning C and improving my backend knowledge with Nodejs and .NET, while also keeping up to date with Typescript and css newest features. I use Fedora as my OS and VS Code as my IDE.

## Technical Skills
- Languages: Javascript, Typescript, C, C#
- Frameworks & Libraries: React, NextJs, NodeJs, .NET
- Tools & Platforms: Aws, DigitalOcean, Git, Linux, Caddy
